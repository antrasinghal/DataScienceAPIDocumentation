Semantic Search API
===================

The semantic search API supports two endpoints: /query and /document.
The /query endpoint interprets and provides related entities for queries.
The /document endpoint parses a document, either a job or resume, and returns the most relevant semantic entities.

# Versions

-	[Version 2](SemanticSearch2.md)
-	[Version 1](SemanticSearch1.md)

## Versioning

The desired version must be supplied as Accept header in the HTTP request:

```
Accept: application/json;version=2.0
```

Different versions of the API may use different versions of taxonomies. This versioning is stable over the life of the contract version. For example, version 0.8 will always return job_titles with data version CaroteneV3. New contract versions will sometimes include contract upgrades to taxonomy versions.

Our general versioning strategy is available [here](Versioning.md).
